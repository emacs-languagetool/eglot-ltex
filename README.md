# eglot-ltex
> Eglot Clients for LTEX

[![CI](https://github.com/emacs-languagetool/eglot-ltex/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-languagetool/eglot-ltex/actions/workflows/test.yml)

`Eglot` client leveraging [LTEX Language Server](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls).

## 💾 Quickstart

### 🔍 Step 1. Install `LTEX` language server through LTEX's homepage
> Link https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls

Extract the `.tar.gz` file to any location you want.

### 🔍 Step 2. Configure your Emacs configuration

Consider adding this to your configuration.

```el
(use-package eglot-ltex
  :ensure t
  :hook (text-mode . (lambda ()
                       (require 'eglot-ltex)
                       (eglot-ensure)))
  :init
  (setq eglot-ltex-server-path "path/to/ltex-ls-XX.X.X/"))
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create `.dir-locals.el` file in the project root directory to configure the ltex
language server, for example:

```el
((nil .
  ((eglot-workspace-configuration
    . (:ltex-ls  (:language  "en-US"
                  :additionalRules (:motherTongue "de-DE")))))))
```

You can find all possible ltex configuration options
[here](https://valentjn.github.io/vscode-ltex/docs/settings.html). See the
[Eglot manual](https://joaotavora.github.io/eglot/#JSONRPC-objects-in-Elisp) on
how to translate the LSP options into the property-list format that Eglot
requires.
